# In name of Allah

## Introduction
We want a simple messaging application to enable two users, chatting via bluetooth. Note that only text messages will be exchanged.

This application as you may have figured out, has two parts:

1. Finding peer: it should be possible to find & connect to peer by bluetooth
2. Chat page: it is possible to chat with peer in realtime, both sending & receiving chat messages ofcourse needs to be implemented.

### Note
An elegant UI is desired, you can use whatever library you see fit, except anything that implements this challenge as a whole.
